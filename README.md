# parial-self-driving-using-ros

## Target الهدف

driving mode  

driving assistant 

partial self driving 


Hardware component :
(raspberry pi 3+arduino as interface +lidar +accelerator بدال سرعة +camera +touch screen )+ encoder+

Software component :

Linux (Ubuntu dist) +ROS +sensor fusion(with extended Kalmen filter ) +PID +opencv +QT +rosserial 


Problem : 
Detect lane departure ------.> solved by using opencv and lane detection technique

Detect obstacle’s position and velocity ----> solved by using lidar or radar or both 

Detect  the vehicle velocity -----> solved by using encoder 

In the future 

Mapping and localization 
Using artificial intelligent (AI)
Using fuzzy control to get PID parameter  
Using c++ insteed of python for critical nodes(program)
